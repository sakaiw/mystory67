**Story**
Once upon a time there was a girl named Little Red Riding Hood. She wanted to make a pie for her grandma. After going to the supermarket and getting her ingredients, she went to go deliver the apple pie to her grandma.
On her way there, she met a wolf that wanted to eat her. Little Red escaped. But then, when she got to her grandma's place, she had no idea that the wolf was laying in her bed to trick her. Little Red was clueless, and also got eaten.
Then, Little Red and her grandma were very crowded in the wolf's stomach, and they begged him to come out. He said no because then he would be hungry again.
Little Red told the wolf that instead of eating them, they could all have dinner together.
The wolf spit them out, and they all had a fruit salad and Little Red's apple pie for dinner.
